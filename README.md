rHelper FAQs
1. How to get a serial key?
- Go to https://www.buymeacoffee.com/racbd and pledge a beer
- Message me on Discord (Raff#9069)
- Enter your license key
 
2. It's not seeing my exp?
- You have to mark your EXP area (The initial number between the separator "/"), make room for bigger exp numbers.
- Mark your profile/avatar (It's on the upper left of your screen where you see a picture of your character) So rHelper knows where to click to get your EXP.
 
3. It's not working?
- Make sure you head onto the settings part (Click the ⚙️ button) and change your Path to the App Directory (where you installed rHelper) and choose the Includes folder.
- Make sure to Mark your EXP Area as explained on FAQ #2
- Choose your Emulator from the dropdown (This is only need to be done once). Currently rHelper only supports Bluestacks, LDPlayer, and Nox
